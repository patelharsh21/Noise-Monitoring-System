# Noise-Monitoring-System

### Overview
The Noise Monitoring System is designed to detect and alert users when the noise levels in a particular area exceed a predefined threshold. This system utilizes an Arduino microcontroller, a microphone sensor, and a buzzer. It is particularly useful in environments such as libraries, study rooms, and hospitals where maintaining a quiet atmosphere is essential.

### Features
#### Real-time Noise Detection: Continuously monitors noise levels using a microphone sensor.
#### Threshold-based Alert: Activates a buzzer alarm when noise levels exceed a predefined threshold.
#### Adjustable Sensitivity: Allows users to adjust the noise threshold to suit different environments.
#### Simple and Cost-effective: Utilizes readily available components and is easy to assemble and deploy.
